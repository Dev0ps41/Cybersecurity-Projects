Project Overview
The Vulnerability Scanner is a web-based application designed to scan web applications for common vulnerabilities, such as XSS, SQL Injection, and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. It uses Python's Flask framework for the backend and integrates tools like Nmap and OWASP ZAP API for scanning. It supports detailed reporting, automated scanning via cron jobs, and integration with Slack/Email alerts for real-time notifications.

 Tech Stack
Backend Framework: Python (Flask)
Scanning Tools:
Nmap: For network scanning.
OWASP ZAP API: For web application vulnerability scanning.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap for responsive design).
Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL (for storing scan history, configurations, and reports).
Notifications: Slack API, SMTP for Email.
Automation: Cron jobs or Celery (for scheduling scans).
Reporting: PDF/HTML report generation (e.g., using Python libraries like ReportLab or WeasyPrint).


Test OWASP ZAP Integration
Make sure OWASP ZAP is running.
